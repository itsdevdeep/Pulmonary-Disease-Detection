# Pulmonary-Disease-Detection
Overview: This is a Deep Learning project involving the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's).

What it does: When Chest X-ray samples are provided to the model, it is able to predict what Pulmonary Disease a patient is suffering from. The diseases that the model can predict are: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia and Tuberculosis.

How efficient, you may ask? Well, the model obtains an accuracy of about 96% on validation data and around 95.5% on Testing Data.
